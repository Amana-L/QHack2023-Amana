        "With the recent rise in interest in generative models in the classical machine learning domain, there have also been advancements along the lines of using generative models with quantum computing. This interest has varied from using quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) to efficiently load data onto a quantum computer [3] to applications in finance [4].  \n",

        "The objective of this project is to explore the prospects of generative models in the quantum computing paradigm. The paper [1] leverages constrained optimisation problems to define metrics to gauge the models generalization capabilities. The objective function in these problems being similar to the use-case of modern portfolio theory given in [2], is used to demonstrate this advantage. The paper also suggests that quantum-inspired generative models can offer upto a 68× enhancement in the generation of synthetic data compared to classical Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). "

        "The loading of data into quantum states is an obstacle to implementing algorithms on NISQ-era devices because it adds to the computational complexity of the overall algorithm. And in doing so, impairs the quantum advantage that is hoped for in the computation. Quantum generative adversarial networks [3] were proposed to provide some relief to the complexity overhead. \n",
        "\n",
        "This efficient and approximate quantum state loading is done by the algorithm learning the implicit probability distribution underlying the data samples, and then loading this probability distribution into quantum states using a variational circuit. This brings the complexity of loading data from $O(2^n)$ to $O(poly(n))$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Classical Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two parts - the *generator* and the *discriminator*. The generator generates fake data samples with the goal of making them as indistinguishable from real data samples. While the discriminator's goal is to figure out if a given sample is real or fake. Both components are working against each other (adversarially) and their competition captures the implicit probability distribution more clearly. \n",
        "\n",
        "A *qGAN* is when either of the two components of this algorithm is done on a quantum computer. In this instance [3], the qGAN refers to a quantum generator that can create a quantum state which loyally represents the data’s underlying probability distribution.\n",
